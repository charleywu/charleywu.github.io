I'm a PhD student at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality) at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. I am funded by the [International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) on Adapting Behavior in a Fundamentally Uncertain World](https://www.imprs.econ.mpg.de/imprs/student/info/). My main research is on the problem of people learn under uncertainty. Ral-world environments are shaped by uncertainty, making optimal solutions impossible and leading to very different dynamics than those studied under the lens of risk (i.e., when the probabilities of all outcomes are known).  My work has so far focused on three main branches of learning, studying efficient exploration guided by generalization, learning through asking questions, and social learning in the context of different information sharing dynamics.


### Research Interests
My current research interests include:

- *Exploration and Information Acquisition in Uncertain Environments*: How do people cope with the complexity of real-world learning problems where the space of possible actions can be vast or even infinite? Humans display an incredible efficiency in learning and can surpass state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms using only a minute fraction of the same training data. Part of my research seeks to explain this gap between human and machine learing through the notion of *guided exploration* where generalization from previous observations onto unobserved actions can efficiently guide human exploration towards rapid learning rates.

- *Information Search*: People don't only learn through trial-and-error, but also through actively querying the world, by asking questions and performing experiments. What strategies do humans use to probe the uncertainty of the world and how we formulate effective queries?

- *Collective Learning*: Learning doesn't only occur in the void, but involves interacting with others and an exchange of information. How do different network structures influence collective search performance? And when does it make sense to share information with others, even in competitive resource environments?




### Background
Before starting my PhD in 2016, I completed an M.Sc. in Cognitive Science at the University of Vienna, where I was affiliated with the Austrian Institute for Articial Intelligence ([OFAI](http://www.ofai.at/)). Prior to that, I was trained in Philosphy at the University of British Columbia. Currently, I identify as a Cognitive Scientist, but dabble in Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Computational Biology. 

In Fall 2018, I will be a visiting researcher at the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/) headed by Sam Gershman at Harvard University.
